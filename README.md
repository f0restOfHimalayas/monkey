## The Monkey Programming Language & Intepreter

Every interpreter is built to interpret a specific programming language. That’s how you “imple-
ment” a programming language. Without a compiler or an interpreter a programming language
is nothing more than an idea or a specification.
We’re going to parse and evaluate our own language called Monkey. It’s a language specifically
designed for this book. Its only implementation is the one we’re going to build in this book -
our interpreter.

Expressed as a list of features, Monkey has the following:
• C-like syntax
• variable bindings
• integers and booleans
• arithmetic expressions
• built-in functions
• first-class and higher-order functions
• closures
• a string data structure
• an array data structure
• a hash data structure
